# Flutter Basics

## MaterialApp & Scaffold Widgets

They are the most important widgets to build an app, they are the skeleton of an application.

## Points to Remember
* Flutter works with widgets(Its widget over widget over widgets)
* Every widget has arguments, when you use an argument you need to add another widget inside it.
